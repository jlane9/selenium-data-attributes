Structures - Web element templates
==================================

Structures are classes that represent the functionality of various web 'structures'. For instance, simple web structures
might include buttons or text input fields while more complex structures would be forms, tables, dropdown menus.
Structures should be generalized and should not rely on 'plugins' like Bootstrap or other custom libraries.
